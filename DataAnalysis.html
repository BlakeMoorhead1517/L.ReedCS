 <h1>Does cereal placement on shelves affect obesity in children?</h1>


 <h2>Visual 1</h2>


 <p>This chart shows colored dots based on where the cereal are placed, like top shelf, middle shelf and bottom shelf. <br>


   It also shows the number of calories in the cereal. So the higher the numbers are on the Y axis they have more calories.

 <h2>Visual 2</h2>


 <p>


   This pie chart shows us the male-female ratio of obestiy in the world's population based off of age.<br>


   As you can see on the graphs, it shows that as you go up in age


   the male obesity ratio goes up and the female ratio goes down.<br>

 <h2>Visual 3</h2>


 <p>


    This shows the content of sugar in cereals on shelves. <br>


   As you can see on the visual, the highest contents of sugar in cereals are on the top shelf.<br>


   This tells us that stores and companies are not targeting little kids by how much sugar a box of cereal has.

 <h2>Conclusion</h2>


 <p>


   As you can see from the graphs, they show that the higher the sugar and calories contents in cereal are,


    the higher the boxes of cereal are on the middle or top shelfs.<br>


   This tells us that these cereal companies are not targeting little kids with sugary cereals.<br>


   This also tells us that other companies other than cereal companies are


    probably not targeting little kids with sugary products.

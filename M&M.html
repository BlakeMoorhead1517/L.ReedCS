 <h1>How long does it take for a M and M shell to dissolve in hot water?</h1>


 <h2>How We Collected Our Data</h2>


 <p>First we started by opening a bag of M and Ms. Then we filled 3 cups full with really hot water and set them on the table.<br>


   Then we took 1 M and M for each cup of water and put them in the cups of the water. <br>


   Then we started a timer as soon as we put the M and Ms in the cups of water. After that,<br>


   we waited until we saw that the M and M shells were dissolved in the hot water.<br>


   Finally we recorded the times that it took for the M and M shells to dissolve<br>


   and put those times on a Google spreadhseet.<br>

 <h2>How We Analysised Our Data</h2>


 <p>First we looked through all of our data on the Google spreadsheet.<br>


   Then we sorted all of the data from A to Z on the Google spreadsheet.<br>


   After that we calculated the adverage of all of our data.<br>


   These are the adverages of our data by color.<br>


   Blue=1:40<br>


   Green=1:23<br>


   Yellow=1:38<br>


   Purple=1:52<br>


   Pink=1:47<br>


 </p>


 <h2>Visuals</h2>


 <img src=MandMgraph.png style="width:500px;height:328px;">


 <h2>Conclusion</h2>


 <p>We found out that it does not matter what color the shell is.<br>


   The M and Ms have random times to dissolve.<br>


   So the next time you give your 3 year old child M and Ms, just know that all of them will still make a big mess. ;)
